[mod-description]
zk-lib=I'll add a universal command widget in the next major update\n\nProvides, combines, packages libraries, utilities for (new) mods and to the game as tools/features (UI isn't ready yet).\n\nAlso, supports auto-generated mods and has modified event listener and I consider about to provide other extra light files/things for mods.
